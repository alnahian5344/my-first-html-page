    <p>Great sentences are the building blocks of great writing,
        but getting them just right is something that
        even professional writers regularly fuss over.
        There are many ways to muddy a sentence: complicated structure,
        misplaced modifiers, or confusing delivery. Two of the most common
        blunders involve incomplete or run-on sentences, which make writing
        difficult to understand. Luckily we have helpful resources to guide
        you toward writing crisper, cleaner, easy-to-read sentences so that
        your ideas donâ€™t get lost in the shuffle.</p>
